Hello y'all
I am satwika and this is doodle.io

Ever wanted to try making smtg like skribble.io?


This is a multi-user drawing web application built using pubnub real-time network JavaScript API, [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), and vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS. No other libraries or frameworks are necessary.

You can draw with others connected to the application and see these results on their screen in real-time. The connected users' mice movements are tracked as they are drawing and moving around the canvas, and includes a text bubble that showcases a user-input name that is updated in real-time across all user instances.

## Features

* Users can draw and see each others' artwork update in real-time.
* Mouse movements are also tracked in real-time, so users can see the mouse movements of all those connected.
* Each user connected can type in a name, which appears under their stylus mouse. The names can be updated and will be updated in real-time.
* Clear your screen, or clear everyone's screen, by pressing on the waste basket icons.
* The number of users connected is tracked and updated in the top right-corner of the screen by making use of PubNub's Presence detection.
